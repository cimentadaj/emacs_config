#+Title: Steps to install my emacs configuration

The entire config is in =~myinit.org~= with comments.

1. Clone the repository into your =~/.emacs.d/= folder
2. Change the home directory so it matches your home directory (they all start with =~=, so just search in ~myinit.org~)
3. Load emacs.

# Update: This repo has now been superseede by my spacemacs config. See https://github.com/cimentadaj/spacemacs_config
